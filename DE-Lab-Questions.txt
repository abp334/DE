Q1)Design a logic circuit with input signal a and control input b and output x and y to operate as follows: 
when b = 1, output x will follow input a and y will be 0, 
when b = 0 then x = 0 and y will follow a.

Q2)The notation x1,x0 represent 2bit binary number and y1,y0 another 2bit binary number.

	X Y Z  P Q
	0 0 0  0 0
	0 0 1  1 0
	0 1 0  1 0
	0 1 1  0 1
	1 0 0  1 0
	1 0 1  0 1

	1 1 1  1 1
Q5)Counting sequence 0,1,2,3,4,5 again and again(mod-6).

Q6) Combinational circuit with 3 input and 1 output. 
Output is 1 when input is less then 3 otherwise output is 0.

Q7) combinational circuit with input x,y,z and output a,b,c. 
When input is 0,1,2,3 then output is 1 greater then input.
When input is 4,5,6,7 output is 1 less then input.

Q8) Combinational circuit in which input is 4-bit BCD,
then output 7-segment has upper left segment always working.(4,5,6,8,9,0)

Q9) The following english expression describes the way a logic circuit needs to operate in order to
drive a seat belt warning indicator in a car. If the driver is present AND the driver is NOT buckled up AND
the ignition switch is on then turn on the warning light. 
Describe the circuit using equation,truth table,diagram.
